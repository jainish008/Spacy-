# Spacy-
spaCy is designed to help you do real work — to build real products,
or gather real insights. The library respects your time, and tries to avoid wasting it.
It's easy to install, and its API is simple and productive.
During processing, spaCy first tokenizes the text, i.e. segments it into words, punctuation and so on. 
This is done by applying rules specific to each language. 
The quickest way to visualize Doc is to use displacy.serve. 
This will spin up a simple web server and let you view the result straight from your browser. 
displaCy can either take a single Doc or a list of Doc objects as its first argument. 
This lets you construct them however you like – using any pipeline or modifications you like.
